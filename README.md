# Application of LLMs for Phenotype Recognition
Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor's thesis project: **"Application of LLMs for Phenotype Recognition from Medical Reports: An Approach Based on the Human Phenotype Ontology."**

## Overview
This project aims to leverage advanced LLMs to accurately recognize phenotypes from medical reports. <br />
The work involved developing Python scripts for the deployment and customization of local LLMs using Ollama. Key tasks included creating processes for generating precise phenotype predictions and engineering effective one-shot prompts. <br />

Collaboration with medical professionals was crucial for refining the accuracy of the results.

## Usage
1. **Setup:** 
    - Ensure you have Ollama installed and downloaded locally the LLMs used in the code.
    - Ensure you have the necessary directories and files (`Medical Reports` folder and `prompt.txt`).
    - **Note:** Add the reports that you want to analyze to the Medical Reports folder.

2. **Run the Script:**
    - Execute the script to process medical reports and generate results.

4. **Results:**
   - Find the processed reports and a JSON file summarizing processing times in the `Medical Reports Results` folder.
